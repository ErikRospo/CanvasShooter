[-] Need to update shop to only respond to keypresses if the user has enough levels, or if a certain url flag is set
    [ ] Instead, we'll allow the user to open the shop at any time, but the buttons will be greyed out
    [ ] Currently, both 's' and leveling up open the shop.
        [ ] What if, instead, only 's' opens the shop, and it has a display for cached levels.
            
[ ] Need to get icon that opens shop for mobile.
    [ ] Check what is going on with safari and mobile being an issue.
[ ] Audit loading times, and see if we can optimize them.
[ ] Make the upgrades actually affect the player. @started(22-07-12 09:48)
    [ ] due to the way that the callbacks are being instanisated, the buy function never actually gets called.
        [ ] Fix this. BUT HOW?
    [ ] Make sure they are being applied.
[ ] Make the loading screen not glitch out, E.g. displaying the options menu,
    [ ] have all items hidden, and then show them all at once when the page has fully loaded.
[ ] Fix upgrade amount being shown as undefined
    [ ] 1. How did this happen. .__.
    [ ] 2. Fix it.
