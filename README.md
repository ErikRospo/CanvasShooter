# CanvasGame
## Plans
This game is the first big project that I have worked on. In the end, I want the game to be polished, have multiple enemies, have art for the player, bullets, and enemies, and more.
## Credits
This project is a game based on [Chris course's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Yp2yz6-pwhQuPlIDV_mjA) [HTML5 canvas and Javascript Game Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI9idPTT0c4). It is an excellent tutorial, and I highly recommend it for beginners in JS canvas.
